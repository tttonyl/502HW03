PS02 Answers:

If your cluster has 1 node, how many wall clock seconds and how
    many clock seconds (total, across all nodes) will be spent in the map
    phase:

1a.A: 
      mapping wall clock time: 10*31 =310 process one file each time
      mapping total clock time: 10*310 =310

1b. How much time will be spent in the reduce phase:

1b.A: reducing wall clock time: 100      reducing total clock time: 100

1c. How much time will be spent from the beginning of the job to the end:

1c.A: 310 +100 =410

1d. Explain your answer:

1d.A: only one node in my cluster, so the wall clock time equals total clock time.


2: If your cluster has 10 nodes, how many wall clock seconds and how
   many clock seconds will be spent from the beginning to the end?

2.A: wall clock time: if we have 10 nodes, so we can simultaneously handle 10 file.gz at the same time. but there  is still one file need to be process after 3 rounds.after mapping, reducing need 100 seconds. 3*10+10=40seconds  40+100=140

total clock time = 310+100=410

3: If your cluster has 100 nodes, how many wall clock seconds and how
   many clock seconds will be spent from the beginning to the end?

3.A: wall clock time: if we got 100 nodes, we can process them at the same time. that is 10 seconds.
10 +100 = 110

total time : 410

4: If your cluster has 1000 nodes, how many wall clock seconds and how
   many clock seconds will be spent from the beginning to the end?

4.A: the answers are the same to third question. because we just need 31 nodes to obtain the shortest processing time according to the assumption of this question.


Extra_credit_question_1 :

reason 1: The file is mainly for January

reason 2: if we run the weblog_bounds.py we can get the earliest and latest logfile date for each logfile. Just the January 31 has some records for Feb 1st.

Also, the last log was recorded in the morning of Feb 1st . It was just a short period compared with whole day.
